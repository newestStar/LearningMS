These are some of the tools it's built on:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

## Local Setup

### Docker
You need Docker, docker-compose, and git setup on your machine. Refer to [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/). After that, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/frappe/lms
cd apps/lms/docker
docker-compose up
```

Wait for some time until the setup script creates a site. After that, you can access `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and the app's login screen should show up.

### Frappe Bench

1. Setup frappe-bench by following [this guide](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/installation)
1. In the frappe-bench directory, run `bench start` and keep it running. Open a new terminal session and cd into the `frappe-bench` directory.
1. Run the following commands:
    ```sh
    bench new-site lms.test
    bench get-app lms
    bench --site lms.test install-app lms
    bench --site lms.test add-to-hosts

 1. Now, you can access the site at `http://lms.test:8000`
